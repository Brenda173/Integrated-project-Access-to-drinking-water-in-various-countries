# Integrated-project-Access-to-drinking-water-in-various-countries
Using Microsoft Excel to analyze data in the Integrated Project
This was one among my ALX projects in Data Analysis using Excel. 
I organized the data in the correct format. I was able to come up
with Global 2020 Report which contained data visualizations such as Column charts, 100% stacked column chart, Box and Whisker Charts and the analyzed data to answer various questions. I also came up with Pivot tables in the sheet.
I managed to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and relationships in the data such as:

The column chart of the population in rural and urban percentage showed that all population sizes were approximately 50% because the chart lines fluctuated equally above and below 50% line.
Based on 100% stacked column chart, basic,limited,unimproved and surface-level urban access do not increase or decrease based on the share of urban 
population, and we can therefore not estimate any type of relationship between water access and urbanization.
Based on column chart of Average Population size in urban and rural versus income group, I made the following decisions:
The greater the Gross National Income, the more urbanized the region.
High-income countries are more urbanized than low, lower-middle and middle-income countries.
More people included in this dataset live in lower middle income countries than in any of the other types of economies
